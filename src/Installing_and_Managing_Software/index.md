- [**Lutris**](https://lutris.net/about) (_pre-installed_) for non-Steam PC games and non-gaming software.
- **Faugus Launcher**](https://github.com/Faugus/faugus-launcher) (_Available in Bazaar_) as an alternative to Lutris.
- [**Heroic**](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/) (_Available in Bazaar_) for Epic Games, GOG, and Amazon Games integration.
- [**WineZGUI**](https://github.com/fastrizwaan/WineZGUI) (_Available in Bazaar_) for less complicated Windows applications that don’t require special considerations.

>Read the [**Bazzite Gaming Guide**](/Gaming/index.md) for more information on running Windows games on Linux.

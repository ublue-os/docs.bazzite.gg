## Linux Gaming Introduction

Linux gaming being a viable competitor to Windows is a relatively new paradigm. Most Windows exclusive games can run on Bazzite using modern hardware. There are still some rough edges, but gaming on Linux does offer advantages on the appropriate hardware such as better frame-times than on Windows.

## Steam

Steam is the recommended way to play PC games on the Linux desktop as it ships with a compatability layer known as [Proton](https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/1696055855739350561).  If a game has a Linux port that isn't well maintained then it is recommended to try running the game through Proton in its Steam game properties.

#### Denuvo Anti-Tamper DRM Locking Games

Games that use Denuvo Anti-Tamper DRM consider changing Proton versions as activiating the game on different hardware which may cause you to get locked out of the game if you change the Proton version more than 5 times within a 24 hour period.
